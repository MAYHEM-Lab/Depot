### Dataset
A dataset uniquely identifies and encapsulates a typed dynamic digital asset. Datasets serve as the interface for accessing, distributing, analyzing, and auditing data. 
### Segment
A segment is a versioned, discrete, view of a dataset's data. Changes to the underlying dataset are represented as new segments.

### Transformation
A transformation is an immutable methodology for producing new segments of a dataset. Datasets can be created by defining a transformation.
